# Snapshot commands:
# echo 0 > snapshot : Clears and frees snapshot buffer
# echo 1 > snapshot : Allocates snapshot buffer, if not already allocated.
#                      Takes a snapshot of the main buffer.
# echo 2 > snapshot : Clears snapshot buffer (but does not allocate or free)
#                      (Doesn't have to be '2' works with any number that
#                       is not a '0' or '1')
